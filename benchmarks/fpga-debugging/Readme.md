# FPGA Debugging Benchmarks

These repair benchmarks were derived from the 20 executable bugs
collected as part of the ASPLOS'22 paper on
`Debugging in the Brave New World of Reconfigurable Hardware`.
We focused on benchmarks that were small enough and had a simple
enough Verilog coding style in order to be compatible with the
`pyverilog` parser and AST library.
